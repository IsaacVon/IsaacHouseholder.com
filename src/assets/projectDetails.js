      "The chances of lava flowing to your house in Hawaii greatly impacts its value. The government defined “Lava Zones” and gave the public access to a small PDF map of the zones. It is difficult to tell what zone a property is in without obtaining records from the county. Hawaii Lava Zones allows users to input an address and receive a LavaZone number with a pin on a map of where the address is located.",
