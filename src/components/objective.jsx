            The objective of my next career move is to get into the sales side
            of engineering. I love working with people, and many people have
            told me that I would be great at sales. After gaining technical
            industry experience, I am now going to steer my career in this
            direction because I am confident that things will go great and I
            will continue to love the work I do. I plan on moving to Kauai,
            Hawaii this year with my fianc√© and I am searching for a remote
            engineering job that will allow me to pursue my passion in
            engineering as well as live where I want.
