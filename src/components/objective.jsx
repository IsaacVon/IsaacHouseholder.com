            The objective of my next career move is to get into the software
            side of engineering. I noticed that time flew by while programming
            an Arduino at my internship at Bourns Electronics. I later realized
            that the biggest big part of my passion for cars and automotive was
            the challenge of building and making things work. I have always had
            a passion for building things, and software opens up my passion to
            so many new possibilities. In the last several months, I have
            immersed myself in classes and building projects. I have enjoyed the
            challenges and satisfaction of programming. I am confident in my
            programming knowledge and ability to learn code. I am very excited
            about the future of software and how it is improving the world. I
            want to make a positive impact on others with my work.
