            I landed my dream job right out of college, working at Karma
            Automotive. While working there, new technology is what captured my
            attention the most. I purchased a Tesla in 2019, and after using the
            autopilot, I have been permanently in awe of what people are doing
            with software. This is where I have realized that the biggest part
            of my passion for automotive was not the vehicle itself but the
            challenge of creating and building new things. After immersing
            myself in learning and writing code for the last 8 months, it has
            become my passion, and my goal is to make it my career.
